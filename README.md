## Data-Preprocessing-for-HealthCare-Data

# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques used in machine learning workflows to improve model performance. The focus is on preparing raw data for machine learning tasks, including handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical data, and removing outliers. The notebook utilizes a healthcare dataset and evaluates how various preprocessing methods impact the accuracy of the machine learning model.

# Key Features
1. Missing Value Handling: Demonstrates methods to impute or remove missing data.
2. Feature Scaling: Explores scaling techniques such as normalization and standardization for continuous variables.
3. Categorical Encoding: Converts categorical variables into a numerical format using encoding techniques like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
4. Outlier Removal: Identifies and removes outliers to avoid skewed model predictions.
5. Model Evaluation: Tests the effects of preprocessing on model accuracy using common machine learning algorithms.
